# Synchronous-Applications

Monolithic applications are a type of software where all components of the system (e.g., user interface, business logic, and database) are integrated into a single, unified structure. In this architecture, all the components run as part of one application.

### Features of Monolithic Applications

- **Unified Structure:**
    
    All components (frontend, backend, and database) are contained in a single executable or process.
    
- **Simple Development and Deployment:**
    
    Developers manage a single codebase, making development and deployment straightforward.
    
- **Good Performance for Small-Scale Projects:**
    
    Suitable for small or medium-sized projects where speed and simplicity are priorities.
    
- **High Component Dependency:**
    
    Even small changes can require rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.
