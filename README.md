# Synchronous-Applications

Monolithic applications are a type of software where all components of the system (e.g., user interface, business logic, and database) are integrated into a single, unified structure. In this architecture, all the components run as part of one application.

---

### Features of Monolithic Applications

- **Unified Structure:**
    
    All components (frontend, backend, and database) are contained in a single executable or process.
    
- **Simple Development and Deployment:**
    
    Developers manage a single codebase, making development and deployment straightforward.
    
- **Good Performance for Small-Scale Projects:**
    
    Suitable for small or medium-sized projects where speed and simplicity are priorities.
    
- **High Component Dependency:**
    
    Even small changes can require rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.

### Advantages of Monolithic Applications

- **Simpler Initial Development:**
    
    Easier to start for small projects as there’s no need to implement separate services.
    
- **Easier to Manage:**
    
    One codebase and one deployment for the entire application.
    
- **Ideal for Small Teams:**
    
    Suitable for teams that don’t require splitting services.
    
- **High Performance for Simple Requests:**
    
    No inter-service communication means faster response times.

### Disadvantages of Monolithic Applications

1. **Difficult Scalability:**
    
    For large projects, scaling or modifying parts of the system often requires rewriting significant portions of code.
    
2. **High Risk of Changes:**
    
    Small changes can impact the functionality of the entire system.
    
3. **Complex Management for Large Teams:**
    
    Managing a large codebase becomes challenging for big development teams.
    
4. **Long Deployment Times:**
    
    As the application grows, compile and deployment times increase.

### When to Use Monolithic Applications?

- **Small to Medium Projects:**
    
    When the project is small and doesn’t require extensive scalability.
    
- **Small Development Teams:**
    
    When the team is small, and splitting tasks would create unnecessary complexity.
    
- **Limited Timeframe:**
    
    When the project needs to be delivered quickly.

### **Building a Monolithic Application with Django**

Django is designed by default to create monolithic applications, making it straightforward to build a comprehensive application where all parts, such as business logic, presentation layer, and database management, are integrated into a single structure.

---

### **Steps to Build a Monolithic Application in Django**

### **1. Create a Django Project**

First, create a new Django project, which sets up the overall structure of your application.

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

---

### **2. Create Apps**

In a monolithic architecture, each app is responsible for a specific part of the project, but all apps reside within a shared codebase and are interconnected.

```bash
python manage.py startapp blog
python manage.py startapp shop
```

- **Blog App:** Manages posts and articles.
- **Shop App:** Manages products and purchases.

---

### **3. Initial Settings in `settings.py`**

Add the newly created apps to the `settings.py` file.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog',
    'shop',
]
```

---

### **4. Define Models**

Each app defines models related to its functionality. These models directly connect to the database.

### **Blog App (`models.py`):**

```python
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### **Shop App (`models.py`):**

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    description = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

---

### **5. Database Management**

Migrate the models to the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
